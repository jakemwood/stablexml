[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/yakkob/stablexml.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/yakkob/stablexml) | [Test Coverage Report](http://htmlpreview.github.com/?https://github.com/yakkob/stablexml/blob/master/test_coverage.html)

## Authors
This library was written by Jake Wood and James Steinberg for a Software Development (CS 6515) class at Northeastern University.

## Summary

This Node.js module parses an XML string, but also maintains the order of the nodes.  It uses a data format loosely based on xml2js, and uses SAX for the actual XML parsing.

## Example
Coming soon.
